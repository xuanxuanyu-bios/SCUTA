'modDream' is a tools that designed for fitting linear mixed models for single cell RNAseq datasets, especially with longitudinal multi-level design. The algorithm is based on 'Dream' in 'VariancePartition' package.

```{r modDream example, echo=FALSE}
library("zinbwave")
library("DESeq2")
library("edgeR")
library("variancePartition")
# below two lines are to be changed after complete the formulation of package
setwd("C:/Users/xuanxuan/Dropbox/2021_Researches/sectional-temporal-celltype/Rcode/modDream/data")

example.data<-readRDS("example.data.RDS")

counts  <- example.data$counts
coldata <- example.data$coldata
# prepare DESeqDataSet file and specify the variables that are taken into acount handling dropout events. 
fluidigm <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = counts,
                                   colData = coldata,
                                   design = ~ condition + time)
```
The zinbwave function is used to compute observational weights which unlock bulk RNA-seq tools for single-cell applications, as illustrated in (Van den Berge et al. 2018).
```{r modDream example}
zinb <- zinbFit(fluidigm, K=2, epsilon=1000)
fluidigm_zinb <- zinbwave(fluidigm, fitted_model = zinb, K = 2, epsilon=1000, observationalWeights = TRUE)
weights <- assay(fluidigm_zinb, "weights")

```

'voomWithDreamWeights' function is used to transform count data to log2-counts per million (logCPM), estimate the mean-variance relationship and compute observation-level weights. Then, the zinb weights and mean-variance weights are combined together as the overall weights. At last, a three-level linear mixed model is fitted for the data.
```{r modDream example}
d0 <- DGEList(counts)
d0 <- calcNormFactors(d0)
form <- ~ condition + time + (1 + time |individual)
vobjDream = voomWithDreamWeights( d0, form, coldata )
vobjDream.weight<-vobjDream
vobjDream.weight$weights <- weights*vobjDream.weight$weights
```

'getContrast' is used to specify the contrast matrix for linear mixed model. The three-level linear mixed model is  fitted by suing modDream function.
```{r modDream example}
L = getContrast( vobjDream, form, coldata, c("condition1", "condition2"))
fit.modDream     <- modDream( vobjDream.weight, form, coldata, L)
fit.modDream.res <- topTable(fit.modDream, coef="L1", number=nrow(counts) )
head(fit.modDream.res)
```


The 'modDream()' function is modified to replace the 'dream()' function in variancePartition, so that any  function in variance partition that used combined with 'dream()' function can be used in conjuction with 'modDream()' function.
